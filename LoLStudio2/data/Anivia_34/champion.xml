  <description>In most lore, the phoenix is a creature of fire that rises from its own ashes. What few know, however, is that phoenixes are elemental beings, formed by the eternal essences of their native world. Anivia was conceived on a world such as this - a being of the coldest winter, a creature of pure elemental ice. On her world, Anivia was the protector of the frozen wastes and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places. She was consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had seen the world renewed several times. Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled across worlds, and when that day came, she received the call with grace. Seeing the imbalance and injustice on Runeterra, a world lacking elemental protectors, Anivia took her place at the League of Legends. Since her arrival, the Cryophoenix has chosen to live among the highest peaks of the Northern Ironspike Mountains, adjacent to the frozen wastes of Freljord. She has openly claimed this territory as her own protectorate. Surprisingly, Anivia has struck up a friendship with the yeti of this region - a friendship that grows deeper and deeper with each passing moon. She has formed a close bond with two League champions: Nunu (and Willump) and the nomad princess Ashe. In a move that caught the League by surprise, the Cryophoenix recently entreated the summoners of the Institute of War to research a means in bringing across others of her elemental fellows. As a champion, Anivia is revered with a sense of awe by most, but is not the most popular as most consider her unapproachable. Some say the world will end in fire, some in ice. Anivia awaits the inevitable latter.</description>

  <tips>*Timing Flash Frost with Frostbite can lead to devastating combinations.*Anivia is extremely reliant on Mana for Glacial Storm, try getting items with Mana or going for a Crest of the Ancient Golem buff on Summoner's Rift.*Early game her egg can be very difficult for enemy champions to kill. Seize the advantage by playing aggressively.</tips>
  <opponentTips>*Try to gank Anivia when she's laning. With multiple people, it is easier to ensure that her egg dies.*If you're playing a ranged champion, stay far enough away from Anivia so you can dodge Flash Frost more easily.*Try to fight Anivia in the lanes. In the jungle she can block pathways with lower ranks of Crystallize.</opponentTips>
