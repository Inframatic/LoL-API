  <description>There are those who choose not to live in one of the great city-states of Valoran. Instead, they live in remote locales, often as part of a nomad or barbarian tribe. While perils abound in these untamed lands, there is also great freedom in being removed from the politics of Valoran. Tryndamere was born a member of one of these barbarian tribes in northern Valoran. Even as a young boy, it was obvious that he would grow in martial prowess to become one of his clan's greatest warriors. However, as his clan moved south between the Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers in black garb, brandishing symbols of a beast's skull. Despite Tryndamere's pleas, his elder went out to speak with the strangers; they cut him down mercilessly. From there, they began to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the clan. Tryndamere, the sole survivor, hid under the bodies of his dead parents. Upon their bloodied corpses, he swore eternal vengeance on those who took his people from him - the assassins of Noxus. To train himself, Tryndamere voluntarily served under all the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes, learning the ways of the barbarian warrior. Not only did this make him the man he needed to become in order to exact his revenge, it has also garnered him friends and allies among the most powerful barbarian leaders of Valoran. This recently allowed him to unite the barbarians into a single, powerful force - all under his command. Now he has joined the League of Legends to earn enough influence to find a permanent home for his people... and to slake his rage on the champions of his hated foes.</description>

  <tips>*Delaying the activation of Undying Rage is a very effective way to make an enemy champion over-commit to trying to kill you.*Bloodlust is an excellent way to heal Tryndamere. Try not to let it fade off before you activate it.*If the enemy is stacking Armor, try building items like Last Whisper or Youmuu's Ghostblade.</tips>
  <opponentTips>*Try harassing Tryndamere early so he can't kill minions and heal with Bloodlust.*Remember, Tryndamere can only slow you if you are facing away from him.*Most of Tryndamere's damage is physical. If he's getting too strong, consider buying a Thornmail.</opponentTips>
